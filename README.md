## Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15 or later
- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) installed (optional for config detection)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.77.2+ (for building from source)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20.19+ (for frontend development)

## Installation

### From Release (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/jellydn/keybinder/releases)
2. Download the latest `.dmg` file (works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs)
3. Open the DMG and drag Keybinder to your Applications folder
4. Launch from Applications or Spotlight

**Note**: On first launch, you may need to right-click → Open to bypass macOS Gatekeeper.

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jellydn/keybinder.git
cd keybinder
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
# or
npm install
```

3. Build and run:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
# or
npm run tauri dev
```

### Building Release

```bash
bun run tauri build
# or
npm run tauri build
```

The built app will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the app** - You'll see a welcome screen with three options:
   - **Detect Active Config**: Automatically finds your skhd config
   - **Import Existing File**: Browse for a config file
   - **Create New Config**: Start with an empty configuration

2. **Edit Shortcuts**:
   - Click **+ New Shortcut** to add a shortcut
   - Click **Edit** on any shortcut to modify it
   - Click **Delete** to remove a shortcut

3. **Save Changes**:
   - The **Save Changes** button appears when you have unsaved changes
   - Click **Save** to write changes to disk
   - Click **Home** to return to the welcome screen (warns if unsaved changes)

4. **Test Commands**:
   - Click the **▶ Execute** button next to any shortcut to test it
   - View real-time output (stdout, stderr, exit code, duration)
   - **Safety confirmations** for destructive commands (rm, sudo, kill, etc.)
   - **Cancel button** appears during execution to stop long-running commands
   - Commands timeout automatically after 30 seconds

### Keyboard Shortcut Format

Shortcuts follow the skhd format:

```
[modifiers] - key : command
```

Examples:

- `cmd - return : open -a Terminal`
- `cmd + shift - f : open ~`
- `ctrl + alt - b : open -a "Brave Browser"`

### Command Testing Safety

Keybinder automatically detects potentially destructive commands and requires confirmation:

**Destructive patterns detected:**

- File operations: `rm`, `mv`, `cp` with system paths
- System commands: `sudo`, `shutdown`, `reboot`, `killall`
- Permission changes: `chmod`, `chown`
- Package management: `brew uninstall`, `npm uninstall`

**Example workflow:**

1. Create shortcut: `cmd + shift - t : rm -rf /tmp/test`
2. Click **Execute** button
3. ⚠️ **Warning modal appears**: "This command may be destructive"
4. Review command and click **Execute Anyway** to proceed
5. View results: exit code, output, duration

### Importing/Exporting

- **Import**: Click **Import...** to browse for an existing skhd config file

### Service Manager

The Service Manager provides comprehensive monitoring and control of the skhd service:

#### Viewing Logs

1. **Navigate to Service Manager** via the sidebar navigation
2. **Automatic Streaming** - Log stream starts automatically on page load
3. **Historical Logs** - Automatically loads the last 100 recent logs
4. **Progressive Loading** - Scroll to load more historical logs (500 at a time)
5. **Level Filtering**:
   - Click the **filter icon** (after pagination controls) to toggle between views
   - **Error Filter** (warning triangle icon): Shows only stderr messages (critical issues)
   - **Info Filter** (list icon): Shows stdout messages (general information)
   - Filter maintains pagination state when switching
6. **Color-Coded Levels**:
   - 🔴 ERROR: Red text for critical issues
   - 🔵 INFO: Blue text for general information

#### Log Controls

- **Filter Icon**: Click the filter icon (positioned after pagination) to toggle between ERROR and INFO log views
  - Shows warning triangle icon when filtering errors
  - Shows list icon when filtering info logs
- **Pagination**: Navigate through logs 50 entries at a time
- **Descending Order**: Logs displayed newest-first by default (no toggle needed)
- **Auto-scroll**: Enable/disable automatic scrolling to new logs
- **Load More**: Button to fetch older historical logs (500 more entries)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home/End for scrolling

#### Service Management

1. **Monitor Status**:
   - View real-time service state (Running, Stopped, Starting, Stopping, Reloading, Error)
   - See current PID when service is running
   - Status indicator with color coding (green = running, red = error, orange = transitioning)
   - Automatic status polling every 5 seconds with exponential backoff on failures
   - Circuit breaker pauses polling after 5 consecutive failures

2. **Reload Service**:
   - Click **Reload Service** to restart skhd with current configuration
   - Shows "Reloading..." spinner during the operation
   - Service automatically reloads and displays new PID
   - Check logs for reload confirmation messages
   - Success/error notifications with auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

3. **Start or Restart Service**:
   - Use **Start Service** when launchd has registered skhd but it is not running
   - Use **Restart Service** after changing macOS privacy permissions
   - Startup failures remain visible and include the daemon's real diagnostic

#### macOS Accessibility Permission

Keybinder does not request Accessibility permission for itself. macOS grants
permission to the process that reads keyboard events, so the correct target is
the skhd daemon:

- **Original skhd**: Add the exact `skhd` executable used by its launch agent to
  **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**.
- **skhd.zig**: Add `/Applications/skhd.app` to Accessibility. Approve **Input
  Monitoring** too if macOS requests it.

After you enable permission, return to Service Manager and select **Restart
Service**. Keybinder reports permission as granted only after the daemon runs.
Recent daemon messages such as `must be run with accessibility access` are
shown as real failures, not hidden or converted to a generic stopped state.

### Updating Keybinder

Open **Settings → Updates** to check manually or select automatic checks and
downloads. Automatic checks use only the latest stable GitHub release. Beta
workflow artifacts are never placed in the stable feed.

#### Configuration Import Workflow

1. **Import Config**: Click **Import Config** to select an external skhd configuration file
2. **Pending State**: Imported config shows in orange with "(Click 'Reload Service' to apply)" hint
3. **Apply Changes**: Click **Reload Service** to activate the imported configuration
4. **Active State**: Config path returns to normal styling, service uses new configuration

#### Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through all controls, Enter/Space to activate
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full ARIA labels and live region announcements
- **Log Viewer Focus**: Press Tab to focus log viewer, use arrow keys to scroll
- **Status Announcements**: Service state changes announced automatically

## Development Workflow

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 (with Runes mode for reactive state management)
- **Backend**: Rust 1.77.2+ with Tauri v2 framework
- **Build Tool**: Vite 8 with SvelteKit for frontend bundling
- **Package Manager**: Bun (or npm/pnpm as alternatives)
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, cargo test for Rust backend
- **Linting**: ESLint + TypeScript + cargo clippy

**Note on Svelte 5**: This project fully embraces Svelte 5's runes mode (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`, `$effect`) for cleaner, more explicit reactivity. All components use modern syntax including `{@render children()}` instead of slots and `onclick={}` instead of `on:click={}`.

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated quality checks and releases:

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Trigger**: Every push and pull request
- **Checks**:
  - Rust: `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo check`
  - TypeScript: `bun run typecheck`
  - Runs on macOS latest
- **Badge**: ![CI](https://github.com/jellydn/keybinder/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

#### Automated Releases

- **Trigger**: Push version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.0-beta.1`)
- **Output**: Universal DMG (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- **Location**: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jellydn/keybinder/releases)
- **Badge**: ![Release](https://github.com/jellydn/keybinder/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

Stable releases also upload `latest.json` and a signed macOS updater archive.
The release workflow requires these GitHub Actions secrets:

- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` for the
  mandatory Tauri update signature. Back up this key; existing installations
  cannot trust a replacement key.
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, and
  `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` for Developer ID signing.
- `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` for notarization. The
  password must be an Apple app-specific password.

The Tauri update signature authenticates an update but does not replace Apple
Developer ID signing or notarization. Configure both before publishing a build
for end users.

#### Creating a Release

```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# 1. Build universal DMG
# 2. Create GitHub release
# 3. Upload DMG as downloadable asset
```

### Spec-Kit Development

This project uses [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for specification-driven development. Each feature is documented in the `specs/` directory.

### Understanding Spec-Kit

**TL;DR**: Spec-kit is great for greenfield projects, less practical for ongoing development. Use it for initial feature planning, but expect to deviate during implementation.

**What it's good for:**

- ✅ Initial feature planning and requirements gathering
- ✅ Creating structured documentation for new features
- ✅ Establishing project constitution and coding standards
- ✅ Generating implementation tasks from specifications

**Limitations in real-world usage:**

- ❌ Assumes specs remain static during implementation (rarely true)
- ❌ No clear guidance for handling PR feedback or bug fixes
- ❌ Designed for research/academic contexts, not production workflows
- ❌ Spec-to-code sync breaks down quickly in iterative development

### How We Use Spec-Kit

We use a **pragmatic subset** of spec-kit for initial planning only:

#### 1. **Initial Feature Specification**

```bash
# Create a new feature spec (creates branch and spec directory)
/speckit.specify <description of what you want to build>

# Example: /speckit.specify Add configuration import/export functionality
# Creates: specs/002-config-import-export/spec.md
# Creates branch: 002-config-import-export
```

#### 2. **Implementation Planning**

```bash
# Generate technical plan from specification
/speckit.plan <tech stack and architecture decisions>

# Example: /speckit.plan Use Rust rfd crate for file dialogs, existing parser
# Creates: specs/002-config-import-export/plan.md
```

#### 3. **Task Breakdown**

```bash
# Generate implementation tasks
/speckit.tasks

# Creates: specs/002-config-import-export/tasks.md
```

#### 4. **After That: Normal Development**

Once specs and tasks are generated, we **abandon strict spec-kit workflow**:

- ✅ Implement features based on tasks.md
- ✅ Fix bugs as they're discovered (don't update specs retroactively)
- ✅ Handle PR feedback directly in code
- ✅ Make UX improvements based on testing
- ✅ Update CLAUDE.md with tech stack changes (not specs)

**Why?** Because real development is iterative, specs get stale quickly, and maintaining spec-to-code sync is overhead without value.

### Feature Development Process

Our actual workflow (spec-kit + pragmatic deviations):

```bash
# 1. Plan feature with spec-kit
/speckit.specify <feature description>
/speckit.plan <technical approach>
/speckit.tasks

# 2. Normal development
git checkout -b <feature-branch>
# Implement features from tasks.md
# Run tests: bun run typecheck, cargo test, cargo clippy
# Iterate based on feedback

# 3. PR and review
git commit -m "Implement <feature>: what, why, how"
gh pr create --title "Feature: <name>" --body "..."

# 4. Handle feedback PRAGMATICALLY
# - Fix bugs in code (don't update specs)
# - Address PR comments directly
# - Update docs/checklists with lessons learned
# - Specs are historical record, not living docs
```

### Directory Structure

```
specs/
  001-skhd-config-gui/       # Initial GUI feature
    spec.md                   # Requirements and user stories
    plan.md                   # Technical implementation plan
    tasks.md                  # Task breakdown
    data-model.md            # Data structures
    contracts/               # API contracts
  002-config-import-export/  # Import/export feature
    spec.md
    plan.md
    tasks.md
    ...
```

**Note**: Files in `specs/` are **reference documentation** for feature planning. Don't expect them to match current code exactly—they represent the initial plan, not the evolved implementation.

### Spec-Kit Decision Framework

When working with spec-kit, use this framework to decide whether to update specs:

#### ✅ Update Specs When:

- **Missing requirements discovered** (accessibility, security, performance)
  - Example: PR feedback reveals missing aria-labels → Add NFR to spec
- **Acceptance criteria incomplete/wrong**
  - Example: Edge case not covered → Update scenarios
- **New constraint for ALL future features**
  - Example: File size limits, browser compatibility
- **Production incident reveals spec gap**
  - Example: Crash on large files → Add performance NFR
- **API contract changes**
  - Example: New required parameter → Update contracts

#### ❌ Don't Update Specs (Just Fix Code):

- Typos or syntax errors
- Better variable naming
- Code refactoring (same behavior)
- Performance optimization (already meets spec)
- Bug in implementation logic (spec was correct)
- UI polish/styling tweaks

#### 🔄 Real Example from This Project:

**PR Feedback**: "Missing aria-labels on icon buttons"

**Spec-Kit Approach:**

1. Recognized as **spec gap** (accessibility requirement missing)
2. Updated `specs/003-shortcut-duplicate/spec.md` with NFR-A01 to NFR-A04
3. Fixed code (added aria-labels)
4. Updated checklist (marked accessibility complete)
5. **Result**: Future features won't miss this requirement

#### 📚 Full Methodology Guide

See [`claudedocs/spec-kit-methodology-summary.md`](claudedocs/spec-kit-methodology-summary.md) for:

- Complete decision frameworks
- Handling PR comments, bug fixes, production issues
- When spec-kit works well vs. when to adapt
- Team collaboration workflows
- Lessons learned from real implementation

### Contributing

When adding features:

1. Use spec-kit for initial planning (specify → plan → tasks)
2. **During PR review**: If feedback reveals missing requirements, update specs
3. Create clear, focused PRs with "what, why, how" descriptions
4. Run tests before committing: `bun run typecheck && cargo test && cargo clippy`
5. Use judgment: Update specs for missing requirements, just fix code for implementation bugs
